# Session-3: Deployment Methods for Every Scale

When describing deployment approaches like "all at once", "rolling", and "blue-green" in the context of CI/CD, it's essential to highlight their key characteristics, benefits, and potential drawbacks.

These descriptions help illustrate the different strategies, highlighting the trade-offs between simplicity, risk, and resource requirements.

### All at Once Deployment

**Description:** 
- The "all at once" deployment approach, also known as a "big bang" deployment, involves updating all instances of an application simultaneously to the new version.

**Benefits:**
- Simplicity: It's straightforward to implement and manage.
- Speed: The deployment process is quick since all instances are updated at once.

**Drawbacks:**
- High Risk: If something goes wrong, the entire application can be impacted, leading to potential downtime.
- No Rollback: Rolling back to the previous version can be complex and time-consuming if issues arise.

### Blue-Green Deployment

**Description:**
- Blue-green deployment involves maintaining two identical production environments. The current version (blue) runs in one environment, while the new version (green) is deployed to the other. Traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green one once the new version is verified to be stable.

**Benefits:**
- Minimal Downtime: Switching traffic between environments is nearly instantaneous, reducing downtime.
- Easy Rollback: If issues are detected, traffic can quickly revert to the previous environment.

**Drawbacks:**
- Resource Intensive: Requires double the infrastructure since two environments need to be maintained simultaneously.
- Complexity: Managing two separate environments can add complexity to the deployment process.

### Rolling Deployment

**Description:**
- Rolling deployment gradually replaces instances of the current version of the application with instances of the new version. This is done incrementally, one instance (or a few instances) at a time, until all instances are updated.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced Risk: Only a small portion of the system is updated at any given time, minimizing the impact of potential issues.
- Continuous Availability: The application remains available throughout the deployment process.

**Drawbacks:**
- Slower Deployment: It takes longer to complete the deployment since instances are updated sequentially.
- Complexity in Management: Requires careful orchestration to ensure that the system remains stable and consistent during the transition.
